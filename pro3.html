                <h2>Precautions for Poor Air Quality</h2>
                <img src="images/q1.webp"><br>
                <p class="h1">
                        When air quality is poor, as indicated by the Air Quality Index (AQI),
                        it’s important to take precautions to protect your health,
                        especially  if you are in a sensitive group (like children, elderly people, or those with respiratory or heart conditions).<br>
                        Here are some key precautions you can take:</p>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                        1.<b><u>Stay Informed:</u></b><br>
                         Monitor the local air quality reports. Many websites and
                        mobile apps provide real-time AQI updates.<br></p>

                       <p> 2.<b><u> Limit Outdoor Activities:</u></b><br>
                        When AQI levels are high (generally above 100),
                        try to stay indoors. This is particularly important for sensitive groups. If you must go outside,
                        try to limit the time you spend outdoors and avoid strenuous activities that increase your breathing rate.<br></p>

                        <p>3. <b><u>Keep Windows and Doors Closed:</u></b> 
                        <br>To keep indoor air as clean as possible,
                        keep windows and doors shut especially during periods of high pollution.<br></p>

                        <p>4.<b><u> Use Air Conditioning:</u></b><br> 
                        If you have air conditioning, use it in recirculation mode
                        to avoid pulling in outdoor air. Make sure the filter is clean and meets high-efficiency
                        particulate air (HEPA) standards if possible.<br></p>

                        <p>5.<b><u> Air Purifiers:</u></b><br> 
                        Consider using air purifiers with HEPA filters in the rooms you use most often.
                        These can help reduce indoor particle levels.<br></p>

                        <p>6.<b><u> Avoid Sources of Indoor Pollution:</u></b><br>
                        Minimize activities that increase indoor pollution
                        like smoking, burning candles, frying food, or using gas stoves. If you must cook, use exhaust fans.<br></p>

                       <p> 7.<b><u> Stay Hydrated:</u></b> 
                        <br>Drink plenty of water throughout the day as hydration can help your
                        respiratory system handle pollution better.<br></p>

                       <p> 8.<b><u> Face Masks:</u></b> <br>
                        If you need to go outside in very poor air quality conditions, wearing
                        a N95 or P100 respirator can help filter out harmful particles. Ensure that the mask fits properly.<br></p>

                       <p> 9.<b><u> Consult Healthcare Providers:</u></b> <br>
                        If you have pre-existing health conditions, consult with 
                        healthcare providers for more personalized advice. They might recommend adjusting your medication
                        or taking other specific measures during high pollution days.<br></p>

                        <p>10.<b><u> Plan Activities Wisely:</u></b> <br>
                        Try to schedule outdoor activities for times when the AQI is
                        forecasted to be lower, usually in the early morning or late evening.<br></p>

                       <p>11.<b><u> Vehicle Cabin Filters:</u></b> <br>
                        For those who must travel by car, ensure that the cabin air filters 
                        are clean and functioning properly to reduce exposure to pollutants.<br></p>

                       <p>12.<b><u> Prepare for Emergencies:</u></b><br>
                         If you live in an area where poor air quality is frequent, prepare
                        a clean room that can serve as a sanctuary on very bad days. This room should have
                        few pollution sources and an air purifier.</p>
